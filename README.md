# MapHive.WebClient.Hosted

An example of a MapHive app that:
* can work on its own (in standalone mode) - in this case switching apps mens redirecting to a new url
* as well as within an iframe - in this case the app just communicates a need for switching the context, and the host app takes care of handling it
